'''
TCP ISN greatest common divisor (GCD)

The SEQ test sends six TCP SYN packets to an open port of the target machine and 
collects SYN/ACK packets back. Each of these SYN/ACK packets contains a 32-bit 
initial sequence number (ISN). This test attempts to determine the smallest number 
by which the target host increments these values. For example, many hosts (especially old ones) 
always increment the ISN in multiples of 64,000.

The first step in calculating this is creating an array of differences between
 probe responses. The first element is the difference between the 1st and 2nd 
 probe response ISNs. The second element is the difference between the 2nd and 
 3rd responses. There are five elements if Nmap receives responses to all six probes. S
 ince the next couple of sections reference this array, we will call it diff1. 
 If an ISN is lower than the previous one, Nmap looks at both the number of values 
 it would have to subtract from the first value to obtain the second, 
 and the number of values it would have to count up (including wrapping 
 the 32-bit counter back to zero). The smaller of those two values is stored 
 in diff1. So the difference between 0x20000 followed by 0x15000 is 0xB000. 
 The difference between 0xFFFFFF00 and 0xC000 is 0xC0FF. This test value 
 then records the greatest common divisor of all those elements. 
 This GCD is also used for calculating the SP result.
TCP ISN counter rate (ISR)

This value reports the average rate of increase for the returned 
TCP initial sequence number. Recall that a difference is taken between 
each two consecutive probe responses and stored in the previously discussed 
diff1 array. Those differences are each divided by the amount of time elapsed 
(in secondsâ€”will generally be about 0.1) between sending the two probes which 
generated them. The result is an array, which we'll call seq_rates containing 
the rates of ISN counter increases per second. The array has one element for 
each diff1 value. An average is taken of the array values. If that average is
 less than one (e.g. a constant ISN is used), ISR is zero. Otherwise ISR is 
 eight times the binary logarithm (log base-2) of that average value, rounded
  to the nearest integer.
TCP ISN sequence predictability index (SP)

While the ISR test measures the average rate of initial sequence number 
increments, this value measures the ISN variability. It roughly estimates
 how difficult it would be to predict the next ISN from the known sequence 
 of six probe responses. The calculation uses the difference array (seq_rates) 
 and GCD values discussed in the previous section.

This test is only performed if at least four responses were seen. If the 
previously computed GCD value is greater than nine, the elements of the 
previously computed seq_rates array are divided by that value. We don't do 
the division for smaller GCD values because those are usually caused by chance. 
A standard deviation of the array of the resultant values is then taken. If the 
result is one or less, SP is zero. Otherwise the binary logarithm of the result 
is computed, then it is multiplied by eight, rounded to the nearest integer, 
and stored as SP.

Please keep in mind that this test is only done for OS detection purposes and 
is not a full-blown audit of the target ISN generator. There are many algorithm 
weaknesses that lead to easy predictability even with a high SP value.
